# tablas

A program that creates .txt documents which store multiplication tables of a given 'n' number provided by the user. Also, it allows the user to read already existing .txt files of any particular number and in case they are inexistent, it allows you to create one. 

The idea with this project was to practice handling, writing and reading documents using Python; and also being able to develop a user-friendly program free of errors, using validation and exceptions to avoid crashes.
